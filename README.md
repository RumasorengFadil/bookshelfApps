## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi, I am Fadil, I am a 5th-semester student in the information systems study program. I am currently focusing on developing myself in the field of programming, especially in web-based programming and also android. I have a fairly strong understanding of the two programming languages used in web application development and also Android, namely javascript and kotlin. I hope that in the future I can improve my understanding of these fields even further.
